The idea to start a league of legends website came from Stephanie wanting to do web development and I(Lacie) having a passion for playing League of Legends. Due to the late start of our project we did not have time to do a full proposal and have a complete idea of exactly what we are wanting to accomplish. For now we know that we want a party suggestion feature where you can enter up to 5 user names, integrated graphs of data collected, and user profiles containing information about that user which may later on have ability to create and save character guides. \r\n\r\n### CURRENT PROGRESS\r\nCurrently we have login/logout users with sessions that allow remaining logged in until session is destroyed. We have an API wrapper for the LOL api so its easier to access, this took quite a long time to set up due to the amount of api calls that can be made. Our website is up and running, we are using Heroku to host our site. \r\n\r\n### NEXT STEP\r\nOur next step is to start using the data to create integrated graphs, we will be using d3.js which is a library for visualizing data. After we get a couple graphs up we will start on the party suggestion feature. ",
