<p>We had some difficulties getting a project rolling and had to basically start new this semester with a different project. The idea to start a league of legends website came from Stephanie wanting to do web development and I(Lacie) having a passion for playing League of Legends. Due to the late start of our project we did not have time to do a full proposal and have a complete idea of exactly what we are wanting to accomplish. For now we know that we want a party suggestion feature where you can enter up to 5 user names, integrated graphs of data collected, and user profiles containing information about that user which may later on have ability to create and save character guides. </p>

<h3>
<a id="current-progress" class="anchor" href="#current-progress" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>CURRENT PROGRESS</h3>

<p>Currently we have login/logout users with sessions that allow remaining logged in until session is destroyed. We have an API wrapper for the LOL api so its easier to access, this took quite a long time to set up due to the amount of api calls that can be made. Our website is up and running, we are using Heroku to host our site. </p>

<h3>
<a id="next-step" class="anchor" href="#next-step" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>NEXT STEP</h3>

<p>Our next step is to start using the data to create integrated graphs, we will be using d3.js which is a library for visualizing data. After we get a couple graphs up we will start on the party suggestion feature. </p>
